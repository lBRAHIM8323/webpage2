## Project Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Single-Page Application (SPA) Design**
- **Approach:** All content in a single `index.html` file with section-based navigation
- **Rationale:** Simplifies deployment and maintenance while providing smooth user experience
- **Implementation:** Uses anchor links (`#home`, `#about`, etc.) for navigation between sections

**Styling Architecture**
- **Approach:** CSS custom properties (CSS variables) for theming at `:root` level
- **Rationale:** Enables easy customization of colors, fonts, and spacing by changing values in one location
- **Key Design Patterns:**
  - CSS Grid for all layouts (hero, about, projects, contact)
  - Flexbox for smaller components (navigation, buttons, tags)
  - Mobile-first responsive design with breakpoints at 768px (mobile) and 968px (tablet)
  - Smooth animations using CSS keyframes and transforms

**JavaScript Functionality**
- **Approach:** Vanilla JavaScript without frameworks for lightweight performance
- **Rationale:** Keeps the site fast and reduces dependencies
- **Key Features:**
  - Dark mode toggle with localStorage persistence (saves user preference)
  - Background particle animations (15 floating particles with random sizes/positions)
  - Projects show/hide toggle (displays first 6, expandable to all)
  - Certifications show/hide toggle (displays first 6, expandable to all)
  - Scroll-based navbar styling (transparency/blur effect, dark-mode compatible)
  - Mobile hamburger menu toggle with smooth animation
  - Intersection Observer for scroll animations
  - Form handling with Formspree integration
  - Active navigation link highlighting

### Responsive Design Strategy

**Breakpoints:**

- Loading state during submission

## Development Workflow

**Serving the Website:**
- Workflow configured: `python3 -m http.server 5000`
- Accessible at port 5000
- No build process required (static HTML/CSS/JS)

**Testing:**
- Manual browser testing across devices
- Responsive design testing using browser DevTools
- Form submission testing with Formspree

## Deployment Options

## Maintenance Notes

**To update content:**
1. Open `index.html` and find the relevant section

3. Update text, links, or images as needed
4. Save and refresh browser to see changes

**To change colors:**
1. Open `style.css`
2. Find `:root` section (lines 13-35)
3. Update CSS variables (e.g., `--primary-color`)
4. All elements using that color will update automatically

**To add new sections:**
1. Copy existing section structure from `index.html`
2. Add navigation link in navbar
