3. **Test Experience Dropdown**:
   - Click on any position card to expand/collapse details
   - Use keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space, Escape)
   - Verify smooth animations

4. **Test Projects Display**:
   - Confirm only 6 projects are initially visible
   - Click "View All Projects" button
   - Verify staggered animation reveals remaining 4 projects

5. **Test Certifications Grid**:
   - Verify uniform card heights and consistent spacing
   - Check hover effects match project card behavior
   - Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
